Feature: Inventory Transaction Table Logic

  Scenario: Generate SQL-based logic for Inventory Transaction Table
    Given the field mappings are provided in the attached Excel file
    When I develop SQL-based logic for the Inventory Transaction table (f_inv_movmnt)
    Then the logic should map each field in the target table from the corresponding source tables

  Scenario: Handle data type discrepancies
    Given potential discrepancies between source and target data types or formats
    When developing the SQL-based logic
    Then ensure data type conversions are handled appropriately

  Scenario: Error and exception handling
    Given the data import/export process
    When an error or exception occurs
    Then the process should handle errors gracefully and log the exceptions

  Scenario: Validate data transformation and loading
    Given the data transformation and loading process
    When the SQL-based logic is executed
    Then validate the correctness of the data transformation and loading

  Scenario: Schedule for running SQL-based logic
    Given the requirement to run the SQL-based logic
    When determining the frequency or schedule
    Then establish a schedule for running the SQL-based logic as needed
