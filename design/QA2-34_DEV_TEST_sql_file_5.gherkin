Feature: Jira Forge App Development

  Background:
    Given a Jira Forge app is required
    And the app should integrate with a database schema named "purgo_playground"

  Scenario: Define the purpose and functionality of the Jira Forge app
    Given the app's functionality is not specified
    When the app's purpose is clarified
    Then the app should have a defined functionality and target users

  Scenario: Integrate Python script data into the app
    Given a Python script that converts CSV data into a list of dictionaries
    And the data pertains to wine quality attributes
    When the role of this data in the app is clarified
    Then the script should be documented and integrated into the app's architecture

  Scenario: Define the role of database tables in the app's backend
    Given multiple SQL files define tables in the "purgo_playground" schema
    And the purpose of these tables in relation to the app is not specified
    When the relationship between these tables and the app is defined
    Then the app should interact with these tables as specified

  Scenario: Consolidate SQL files for consistency
    Given there are multiple SQL files with similar table definitions
    When the SQL files are consolidated
    Then redundancy is avoided and consistency is ensured across table definitions

  Scenario: Develop comprehensive requirements documentation
    Given the requirements lack detail on the app's functionality, user interface, and integration points
    When detailed requirements documentation is developed
    Then user stories, use cases, and acceptance criteria are included
    And the development process aligns with the project's goals
