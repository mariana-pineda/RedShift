#### 1. Component Architecture

- **Major Components and Interactions:**
  - **CSV Reader Component:** Reads `d_product_revenue.csv` and `customer.csv` from the specified file paths.
  - **Data Transformation Component:** Performs the join operation and transformation logic as specified in the mapping document.
  - **SQL Query Executor:** Executes the Databricks SQL query to produce the final output.
  
- **Input/Output Interfaces:**
  - **Input:** 
    - `d_product_revenue.csv` located at `/Volumes/agilisium_playground/purgo_playground/d_product_revenue_csv/d_product_revenue.csv`
    - `customer.csv` located at `/Volumes/agilisium_playground/purgo_playground/d_product_revenue_csv/customer.csv`
  - **Output:** 
    - Resultant dataset with a `surrogate_key` column, ready for further processing or storage.

- **Dependencies and External Systems:**
  - **Databricks Environment:** Required for executing SQL queries.
  - **File System Access:** Necessary for reading the CSV files from the specified paths.

#### 2. Data Flow

- **Data Transformation Steps:**
  1. **Read CSV Files:** Load `d_product_revenue.csv` and `customer.csv` into DataFrames.
  2. **Join Operation:** Perform a left join on `customer_id` between the two DataFrames.
  3. **Surrogate Key Generation:** Concatenate all columns post-join and apply a hashing function (e.g., SHA-256) to generate the `surrogate_key`.

- **Data Formats and Schemas:**
  - **CSV Format:** Assumed to be comma-separated with headers.
  - **Schema for `customer.csv`:** As defined in the provided SQL table creation script.
  - **Schema for `d_product_revenue.csv`:** To be inferred from the CSV file.

- **Validation Rules and Error Handling:**
  - **Validation Rules:**
    - Ensure `customer_id` exists in both datasets before joining.
    - Validate data types as per the target schema.
  - **Error Handling:**
    - Log errors for missing `customer_id` values.
    - Handle data type mismatches by logging and skipping erroneous records.

#### 3. Implementation Steps

- **Development Steps:**
  1. **Setup Databricks Environment:** Ensure access to the file system and necessary permissions.
  2. **Read CSV Files:** Use Databricks utilities to load the CSV files into DataFrames.
  3. **Perform Join Operation:** Execute a left join on `customer_id`.
  4. **Generate Surrogate Key:** Concatenate columns and apply SHA-256 hashing.
  5. **Write SQL Query:** Formulate the final SQL query incorporating all transformations.

- **Order of Implementation:**
  1. Setup environment and read CSV files.
  2. Implement and test the join operation.
  3. Develop and validate the surrogate key generation logic.
  4. Write and test the complete SQL query.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Successful reading and joining of CSV files.
  - Correct generation of `surrogate_key` for all records.
  - SQL query executes without errors and produces expected results.

#### 4. Technical Considerations

- **Performance Requirements:**
  - Optimize the SQL query for efficient execution on large datasets.
  - Use indexing on `customer_id` if possible to speed up join operations.

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Ensure data access permissions are correctly configured in Databricks.
  - Use secure methods for handling sensitive data, especially during surrogate key generation.

- **Scalability Aspects:**
  - Design the solution to handle increasing data volumes by leveraging Databricks' distributed computing capabilities.
  - Consider partitioning large datasets to improve query performance.
